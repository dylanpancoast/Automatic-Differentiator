1. So since our far for our Milestone 1 submission, we have set up our package software organization and created a skeleton for the automatic differentiation forward pass. The team08 folder contains a LICENSE file, as chosen and provided by Dylan. It contains a pyproject.toml file to format uploading the package to test.pypi.com for distribution, as provided by Em. It contains a src/ folder, with a skeleton  __init__.py folder containing a partially implemented dual numbers class. Finally, it contains a docs/ folder, with a milestone1.md written and updated by Alyssa and Dylan, and an implementation.pdf file expanding on our implementation made by Nick.
2. For our final Milestone 2 submission, the work is divided as follows; first, all participants will continue to work on __init__.py to make the forward pass implementation, including providing support for powers, exponentiation, and trigonometric functions in the dual numbers class, along with helper functions to calculate directional derivatives. Once this is satisfactory, Em and Nick will design the test suite, while Alyssa and Dylan provide documentation for the package. Finally, the group will reconvene to agree on additional features for the final submission.
