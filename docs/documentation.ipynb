    "# Intro\n",
    "Our package `automaticdifferentiationTeam08` solves the problem of differentiating real-valued functions by hand by automating the process and executing that automation with a compatible computer. This could help those who have the need to differentiate real-valued functions in large volumes to save time. To achieve this, both forward mode and reverse mode automatic differentiation algorithms are implemented. It also contains a helpful Newton's method algorithm that can be used to find the roots of a function. The package is written in Python 3.9 and is compatible with Python 3.9 and above. \n",
    "\n",
    "The package contains three modules: `forwardmode`, which contains support to calculate the directional derivative of a function using forward mode automatic differentiation, `reversemode`, which contains support to calculate the gradient of a function using reverse mode automatic differentiation, and `newton`, which contains a function that uses the derivative of a function to find the roots of a function, using Newton's method."

    "# Background\n",
    "**Auto differentiation** (AD) is the process of using software to compute the derivative of a given function. AD accomplishes this by employing a few key concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Chain Rule:** in Calculus, the chain rule is used to calculate the derivative of composite functions. The chain rule for composite function h = f(g(x)) is h’ = f’(g(x)) * g’(x). In other words, the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Modes (accumulation):** refers to the “direction” in which the auto differentiator applies the chain rule. Forward accumulation approaches the function from the inside and works outward and is the mode upon which this package concentrates. A given function is expressed as a composition of elementary functions, which include arithmetic operations and standard transcendental functions such as sin, cos, and exp. The structure by which the functions feed into each other is summarized in a directed computational graph. In forward mode AD, derivatives of the elementary functions are computed from the beginning to the end of the graph, and combined using the chain rule. Reverse mode AD, on the other hand, starts at the output and works backwards through the graph, applying the chain rule at each elemental step. The reverse mode approach is more efficient, but requires more memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dual numbers:** dual numbers are an augmentation of the algebra of real numbers. In the dual number paradigm, each number contains an additional component designating the derivative of a function at that number. Arithmetic operators are augmented as well to account for the implications of this. Arithmetic is performed on ordered pairs where regular arithmetic is applied to the first value of the pair and first order derivative arithmetic is applied to the second.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Newton's Method:** Newton's method is a method for finding successively better approximations to the roots (or zeroes) of a real-valued function. To find a better approximation, a tangent line is drawn to the function f at the point where the previous approximation p lies, and the x-intercept of the tangent line is computed. The point where the tangent line intersects the x-axis is the new approximation. The process is repeated until a satisfactory approximation is reached."
