    "# Background\n",
    "**Auto differentiation** (AD) is the process of using software to compute the derivative of a given function. AD accomplishes this by employing a few key concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Chain Rule:** in Calculus, the chain rule is used to calculate the derivative of composite functions. The chain rule for composite function h = f(g(x)) is h’ = f’(g(x)) * g’(x). In other words, the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Modes (accumulation):** refers to the “direction” in which the auto differentiator applies the chain rule. Forward accumulation approaches the function from the inside and works outward and is the mode upon which this package concentrates. A given function is expressed as a composition of elementary functions, which include arithmetic operations and standard transcendental functions such as sin, cos, and exp. The structure by which the functions feed into each other is summarized in a directed computational graph. In forward mode AD, derivatives of the elementary functions are computed from the beginning to the end of the graph, and combined using the chain rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dual numbers:** dual numbers are an augmentation of the algebra of real numbers. In the dual number paradigm, each number contains an additional component designating the derivative of a function at that number. Arithmetic operators are augmented as well to account for the implications of this. Arithmetic is performed on ordered pairs where regular arithmetic is applied to the first value of the pair and first order derivative arithmetic is applied to the second.\n",

    " \n",
    "To compute the directional derivative of a function $f : \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}$ at a point $x = (x_1,\\ldots,x_n)$ in the direction $p = (p_1,\\ldots,p_n)$, first define a python function `func(z1,...,zn)` that mimics the function $f$ but takes instances of `DualNumber` as inputs. Elementary operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division can be written as they would be for real numbers, but for other functions (such as $\\sin$), use the functions provided by `forwardmode` (such as `forwardmode.sin()`). To compute the directional derivative, define the point and vector direction in which to calculate it, each being a python iterable of length equal to the number of function inputs. Plug these into the directional_derivative function, and it will create the appropriate dual numbers, based on the point and direction, and calculate them in the given function. The dual part of the output to the function will be the directional derivative, which is returned as a single scalar by directional_derivative. Here is an example, where we compute a directional derivative of the function $f(x_1,x_2) = \\sin(x_1 + x_2)$:\n",

    "We plan to implement a higher-order derivative finder - that is, a user can give as input a degree, and we will be able to run the AD that many times, feeding its output back into itself on each run.\n",

    "Geffrey: Need to give this more thought and a description of how you plan for it to work besides 'feeding output back onto itself'. Will you code analytical higher-order derivatives for some functions? e.g. x^5 has analytical higher order derivatives which can be computed in one-go? It would be interesting to also implement some functions that relate to the second derivative e.g. to see if the stationary point is minimum or maximum etc.\n",
