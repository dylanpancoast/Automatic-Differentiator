## Overview
This project is a Python package that implements automatic differentiation (AD) for vector and scalar functions, as well as Newton's Method for root finding. The package is designed to be used by a user who wants to compute the directional derivatives of a function. The user can also use the package to find the roots of a function using Newton's Method.
